# Soullocke

**Soullocke** ([soullocke.vercel.app](https://soullocke.vercel.app)) is a tracker built specifically for tracking [soul-linked Nuzlocke](https://pastebin.com/Fg6hfDma) runs. Unlike other Nuzlocke trackers, Soullocke tracks the PokÃ©mon across two trainers with quality of life features to help track which PokÃ©mon are soul-linked.

## âœ¨ Features

Overview of main features. Currently used as a checklist while the project is in development.

- Easily track where PokÃ©mon are caught and when they are boxed, swapped into your team, defeated, etc.
- Timeline view of soul-linked trainers' teams and catches.
- Filter and search tracked PokÃ©mon.

Future features include password lock. Please leave feature requests as an [issue](https://github.com/jynnie/soullocke/issues).

### Open Questions

- Should we save changes automatically or require a manual button press?
  - Automatically for now
- Does this track PokÃ©mon levels and moves?
  - No, decided against adding fine-grain tracking of these details for now
