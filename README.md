# Soullocke

**Soullocke** ([soullocke.vercel.app](https://soullocke.vercel.app)) is a tracker built specifically for tracking [soul-linked Nuzlocke](https://pastebin.com/Fg6hfDma) runs. Unlike other Nuzlocke trackers, Soullocke tracks the Pokémon across two trainers with quality of life features to help track which Pokémon are soul-linked.

### FAQ

- Are changes saved automatically?
  - Yes! Changes are saved in real time, so you don't have to worry about losing your progress. Everyone at the link will see the same changes and can edit in real-time.
- Does this track Pokémon levels and moves?
  - No, decided against adding fine-grain tracking of these details. We're designed for simplicity. If you want that level of detail, we reccommend using a different tracker.
