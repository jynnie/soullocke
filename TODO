🐛 Bugs
- [ ] Add evolution event not working

🌶🌶🌶 Would prominently improve experience & usability
- [X] UX: Move Pokemon to team prompt right after adding Pokemon
- [ ] Timeline: Rearrange locations
- [ ] Timeline: Delete location

🌶🌶 Would improve experience in certain scenarios
- [ ] PokemonIcon: Show evolved Pokemon
- [ ] Timeline: Display pokemon names (possibly events) to the right
- [ ] Pokemon: Edit pokemon name and nickname -- helps when mistakes are made

🌶 Should have, but low value add rn
- [ ] Roam Research style Legend for icons
- [ ] Timeline: Add search and filter
- [ ] Pokemon: Delete
- [ ] Pokemon: Delete event

🧊 Unseasoned thoughts
- [ ] Scrolling?
- [ ] Pokemon: Event Buttons instead of filling out form?
