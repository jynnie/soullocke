🐛 Bugs

🌶🌶🌶 Super cool

- [ ] Timeline: Inline editing
  - [ ] Locations
  - [ ] Origin names
  - [ ] Nicknames
- [x] Box View
  - [x] Drag and drop between categories to move
  - [x] Edit pokemon from view
  - [x] Adding to team needs to make sure not full
  - [x] Add new Pokemon
  - [x] Styling
  - [x] Show current location?
- [ ] Shared type rule (either present suggested parties or a toggle to enforce rule)

🌶🌶 Would improve most experiences or could be cool

- [ ] Skeletons while loading
- [ ] Mobile friendly
- [ ] Cooler summary view styles
- [ ] New region! (Waiting on pokeapi to update tbh)

🌶 Should have, but low value add rn

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Better help center

🧊 Unseasoned thoughts

- [ ] Roam Research style Legend for icons, or make indicators more obvious
- [ ] Pokemon: Event Buttons instead of filling out form?
