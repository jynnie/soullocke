🌶🌶 Would improve most experiences or could be cool

- [ ] Box: Drag and drop between categories to move
- [ ] Event view?

🌶 Should have, but low value add rn

- [ ] Timeline: Inline editing
- [ ] Pokemon: Delete
- [ ] Unit tests

🧊 Unseasoned thoughts

- [ ] Roam Research style Legend for icons, or make indicators more obvious
