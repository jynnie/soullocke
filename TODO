🐛 Bugs

🌶🌶🌶 Super cool

- [ ] Better linting & null checks
- [ ] Enable multiple locations on the timeline
- [ ] Cooler summary view styles

🌶🌶 Would improve most experiences or could be cool

- [ ] Summary: Drag and drop between categories to move
- [ ] Timeline: Inline editing
- [ ] Event view?
- [ ] Box view?
- [ ] Refactor from API -> Hooks

🌶 Should have, but low value add rn

- [ ] Pokemon: Delete
- [ ] Unit tests

🧊 Unseasoned thoughts

- [ ] Roam Research style Legend for icons, or make indicators more obvious
- [ ] Pokemon: Event Buttons instead of filling out form?
